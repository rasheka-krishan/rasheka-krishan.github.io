            <p class="caption">For this project I had to create a little book out of a manifesto of my choice. This manifesto is quite funny to me because it talks about how sci-fi is being turned into more fiction than science and the writter is angry. I decided I wanted to play with layout for this project which is why the paper is so long. The way the manifesto was written was very formal and official sounding which made me think of this bigger and more porminent layout.</p>

This assignment was very handsy as I cut the fonts out without any lines to follow and with scissors. The letters came out very interesting because there weren't any guidelines except for looking at images of old alphabets. In the end I created a cohesive system and a matching envelope. The book takes an accordian fold form.</p>

            <p class="caption">This is a wikipedia page turned into a book. The subject matter allowed me to use different typefaces like typewritter fonts for headings because it reminds me of space. The big creative decision I made this book was having the cover and the start of chapeter all black with one side of the text white and the other side gradiented, as if it's reflective, like water. This book allowed me to work with long pieces and learn how to find balances between multiple typefaces.</p>
